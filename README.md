## 1. About this Portfolio

This was one of my first times ever building a webpage from scratch. It was a great opportunity to not only test my existing knowledge as well as push me into realms of research, hopelessness, and finally success. It has been a great journey of learning this week. My concept for this page was to achieve a modernized and simple while remaining interesting. I do believe there are areas of vast improvement remaining but I am proud of what I have started.

## 3. How to interact with the Portfolio and what to expect!

I was really interested in incorporating animation into my page. Upon arriving or reloading of the page, you'll see a text box with my name and a sub-heading as well as the navigation links begin to fade in. I tried to stagger their timing. Additionally, the "About" text box on the page fades in too. In the work section you'll find two pictures of projects I have completed and when your mouse hovers over them they will grow in size. Lastly, I wanted to make the contact section a bit more interesting beyond simple links or text. I converted the contact links into buttons that also change in size upon your mouse hovering over them. There is still so much more I would like to achieve in general on this page but I am happy with the progress I have made, the amount I learned, and the potential the lays ahead.

### Here you will see a screenshot of the Navigation bar that will redirect users to the corresponding location on the page that they click to.

### Wait...one last thing before you scroll!
It was important for me to make this portfolio a responsive web layout. Below I will attach images. The webpage was designed for mobile, tablet and desktop users alike and the pages layout will change respectively to match each user's preferred or chosen viewing platform.
